Credits to J.Rizzo and T.Duong for providing proof of concept web exploit
techniques and S.Vaudenay for initial discovery of the attack. Credits also
to James M. Martin (research@esptl.com) for sharing proof of concept exploit
code for performing various brute force attack techniques.

PadBuster is a Perl script for automating Padding Oracle Attacks. PadBuster  
provides the capability to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext, encrypt arbitrary plaintext, 
and perform automated response analysis to determine whether a request is vulnerable 
to padding oracle attacks.
